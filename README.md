# Syren

Syren is an easy to learn, easy to play game that helps teach a user how to recognize and match a played musical note.

How it works.

When you launch Syren you can immediately play the game, but it is recommended you sign in.  By signing in, you can track your progress online, share your scores and participate in leaderboards, and you can download packs of musical notes that suit your particular taste.

When the game launches at level one, you'll start with three 'lives', indicated by the green treble clef symbols in the top right corner.  When you press the green 'go' button, you'll hear a perfect pitch musical note, accompanied by one (or more) buttons with possible note matches ABCDEFG.  Think fast, because the green progress bar on the screen is counting down to 0, and will eventually replace the green with red until the controls disapear, and a life is lost.

Each level will present it's own challenges, becoming increasingly difficult as you move ahead.  You have 30 seconds to make your selection.  

Selecting a matching note within the first 10 seconds is considered 'perfect', and there is a random chance this will earn you an extra life, or replace a life you previously lost.  The game is smart enough to know to become more difficult it you quickly answer every challenge.

To proceed to the next level, you'll be presented with 7 randomly selected, and increasingly tough to identify notes.  You must have at least one life remaining after completing all 7 to advance a level.

Selecting a matching note in the last 5 seconds, or missing one altogether can have the reverse effect of the above.  Select too many late and you may have to repeat the level.  Losing all of your lives automatically means you go back to level one.
